# Robotic-Arm-Ball-Game
This Year 2 project developed a robotic arm ball game that picks up small objects and deposits them into a hoop to score points on an LED display. It uses Arduino Mega boards, servo motors, and an IR sensor, with innovative control methods like inverse kinematics for smooth movement.
