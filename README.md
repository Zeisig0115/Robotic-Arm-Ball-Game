# Robotic-Arm-Ball-Game
Our Year 2 project consisted of building a robotic arm capable of picking up small objects. We designed this robotic arm to be accompanied by a simple ball game, intended to be used as a demonstration on the universityâ€™s open days to attract potential new students to the department. Ultimately, we have successfully produced a functioning product. The purpose of this report is to present the design and implementation of our product that allowed us to reach our goals, and the results we found as a result.
